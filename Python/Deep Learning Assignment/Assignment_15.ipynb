Then you will reuse the lower layers of this network to train an MNIST classifier using very little training data. Start by building two DNNs (let\u2019s call them DNN A and B), both similar to the one you built earlier but without the output layer: each DNN should have five hidden layers of 100 neurons each, He initialization, and ELU activation. Next, add one more hidden layer with 10 units on top of both DNNs. To do this, you should use TensorFlow\u2019s\u00a0concat()\u00a0function with\u00a0axis=1\u00a0to concatenate the outputs of both DNNs for each instance, then feed the result to the hidden layer. Finally, add an output layer with a single neuron using the logistic activation function."
